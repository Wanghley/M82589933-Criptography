Project of criptography model creation for educational purposes in order to test new ways of secure data as part of the process of cybersecurity. Furthermore, this repository contains a model in HTML and PNG explaining the logic of the model proposed and also a code of test made in ```python``` to exemplify the model.

## Getting Started

This is a project proposing a new method of crptography to be used based in the highest primer number known, called M82589933, which is 2^(82,589,933)-1. Based on this and some mathematical manipulations messages are encrypted.

## Running

### Prerequisites

You need to install these things to run the project

```bash
pip3 install rich
```

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running


```
git clone https://github.com/Wanghley/M82589933-Criptography
cd https://github.com/Wanghley/M82589933-Criptography
```

And have fun running:

```
cd src/
python3 main.py
```

Then, you will be able to test and modify the project yourself.
